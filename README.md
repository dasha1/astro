#### Manual for Linux/Unix users

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
3. Create GitHub [personal API token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens)
3. Prepare project:
   
   ```bash
   git clone git@gitlab.reclamare.ua:quantinho/yii2-vagrant-start.git
   cd yii2-vagrant-start/vagrant/config
   cp vagrant-local.example.yml vagrant-local.yml
   ```
   
4. Place your GitHub personal API token to `vagrant-local.yml`
5. Change directory to project root:

   ```bash
   cd yii2-vagrant-start
   ```

5. Run commands:

   ```bash
   vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
   vagrant up
   ```

That's all. You just need to wait for completion! After that you can access project locally by URLs:
* frontend: http://y2aa-frontend.dev
* backend: http://y2aa-backend.dev
* myadmin http://phpmyadmin.dev

Yii 2 Advanced Project Template
===============================

Yii 2 Advanced Project Template is a skeleton [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/) application best for
developing complex Web applications with multiple tiers.

The template includes three tiers: front end, back end, and console, each of which
